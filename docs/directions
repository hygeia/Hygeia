Hygeia Project
14 Feb 2012

The docs directory contains documentation detailing various aspects of the 
project. The Java team should read the database documentation and perhaps even
the pages documentation. The JSP team should read about the pages and the
forms documentation. These files should remain up to date with our plans for
each aspect of the project. 

The dumps directory contain the SQL dumps for the database. Each revision of the
database has its own database, which may be reproduced by the dump. hygeia1.sql
is the first dump, and works with the test pages (see test directory). The
hygeia2.sql dump is scheduled to be the first database for use in a Hygeia
build. 

The test directory contains a simple prototype of logging in and out, signing
up, and redirecting the user based on whether the user is logged in or has 
submitted forms. The JSP and HTML teams may want to review this if they do not
have experience with JSP or HTML. 

The WEB-INF directory contains the Java classes and source files. It currently
contains skeleton files for most classes. The User class has only been 
implemented to provide the test pages' functionality. The Database class 
provides rough access to the database (hygeia1 as of this writing). 

The template.jsp file is a template of how the JSP pages should look with some
code reminders.

To create a working copy of this on your system, copy these files into your
Tomcat's ROOT directory. Assuming no other changes, the test pages should
be accessible from http://localhost:8080/test and the m1 pages should be 
found at http://localhost:8080/m1. SQL dumps can be restored to any MySQL
server. The Database class is currently set up to use the default user 
configuration of MySQL, so all that *should* be needed is to run the SQL
statement: source hygeiaX.sql; where X is the version of the database you want
to build (provided your working directory is the dumps directory).
