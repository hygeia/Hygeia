Each user has a home directory. In each home directory is a www

navigate to 132.239.229.86/username. The root of the website (132.239.229.86)
is found at /home/public/www. Your www directory is the location of your git
repository and it is also a workspace for you. 

Make sure to change your password after you login for the first time. Set up
git by following the directions on github (git is installed on Aurora), and
run the setup script. This will ensure your www directory is set up correctly
and the repository has the most recent changes from github.
